# Lesson 06: Webscraping

## Getting to Know `WGET`

Here we will discuss webscraping --- the main process of efficiently collecting large volumes of information from the Internet.

## Software

* `wget` (<https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>), a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive command line tool, so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

* **NB**: on installing `wget`:
	* On Windows (the easiest): download from <https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/> > choose the latest 64-bit ZIP file (`EXE` will most likely be blocked by your browser as a potentially dangerous file).
		* Unzip the file and copy `wget.exe` to the folder where you are planning to scrape data; *NB:* the easiest approach on Windows is to move/copy this file into relevant folders. 
	* On Mac (and, possibly, Linux): `brew install wget`

## Class

* practical examples of working with `wget`
* single link download
* batch download
	* web-page analysis
	* extraction of links with `regular expressions`
	* modification of links with `regular expressions`

## Sample commands

```
wget link
wget -i file_with_links.txt
wget -i file_with_links.txt -P ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/ -nc 
```

<!--
1. The first command will simply download a file specified in the link;
2. The second command will go over all links given in the `file_with_links.txt` --- in this file links must be stored one per line;
3. The third command also redirects downloaded results to a subfolder (`-p ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/`, where `-p` is an argument that specifies that `./folderYouWantToSaveTo/` is a folder for saved results; `-nc` is another useful argument, which tells `wget` not to download file if is already exists in the folder --- this command allows you to stop and restart downloading from where you stopped);
-->

Where:

* `-P` is a folder parameter, which instructs `wget` where you want to store downloaded files (*optional*).
* `-nc` is a *no-clobber* parameter, which instructs `wget` to skips files, if they already exist (*optional*)

Link examples:

https://maximromanov.github.io/dh_in_mes/files/articles/1860-11-12_article_03.txt
```

**NB:** there are many other parameters with which you can adjust `wget` to your needs.

### Running `WGET` on Windows

As we have run into a number of issues with trying to run `WGET` on Windows, here are some steps that will help to run it smoothly:

- download the `wget.exe` file (from here: <https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/>);
- copy/paste it into the `C:\Windows\System32` folder (`C:\Windows\System32` is a part of the so-called `PATH` --- a series of paths which all Windows command line *check*);
- now, all the commands should be working as expected;

## Homework{#HWL06}

1. Scraping the “Dispatch”: download issues of “Richmond Times Dispatch” (Years 1860-1865, only!), which are available at: <http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:RichTimes>)
2. In a separate markdown file (to be uloaded with the rest of your homework).(THIS IS  NOT CLEAR: WHAT IS TO BE SUBMITTED IN A SEPARATE  MARKDOWN FILE?)

**Python**

- Work through Chapters 8 and 11 of Zelle's book; read chapters carefully; work through the chapter summaries and exercises; complete the following programming exercises: 1-8 in Chapter 8 and 1-11 in Chapter 11;
- Watch [Dr. Vierthaler's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kqrM2i6BPIpEF5yHPNkYhjHm-FYWh17):
	- Episode 12: Functions
	- Episode 13: Libraries and NLTK
	- Episode 14: Regular Expressions
- **Note:** the sequences are somewhat different in Zelle's textbook and Vierthaler's videos. I would recommend you to always check Vierthaler's videos and also check videos which cover topics that you read about in Zelle's book.

## Submitting homework{#SHL06}

* Homework assignment must be submitted by the beginning of the next class;
* Email your homework to the instructor.
	* if your homework is to create a file, email it as an attachment
	* if your homework is a blogpost on your website, email the link to your website and to the blogpost with your homework.
	*  In the subject of your email, please, add the following: `070112-LXX-HW-YourLastName-YourMatriculationNumber`, where `LXX` is the lesson for which the homework is submitted, `YourLastName` is your last name, and `YourMatriculationNumber` is your matriculation number.
